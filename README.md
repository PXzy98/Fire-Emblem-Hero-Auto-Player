# Fire-Emblem-Hero-Auto-Player
This FEH open helper is a game helper based on python image recognition. It includes two major functions, an auto wishes helper and main story passer. And it comes with an ugly interface for the detailed settings.
Since FEH is a mobile game, you need to select an emulator wisely. In my test environment, i set up a LDPlayer (Andriod 9) and a MuMu Player 12(Andriod 12) in 540P for testing.

## How to use it

Firstly, you need to take screenshots of the major buttons and icons as templates, they are listed in the "Folder structure" part above. I will provide the templates i used for testing in the sample_pics folder, but they may not be useful even if the settings for emulators are the same with me, due to the slightly difference in the interface(some emulator count the sidebar within the resolution and some are not). I strongly suggest to take screenshot by your own and **keep in mind that once if you change the quality of the resources in game**, the previous templates may not work as well.

Secondly, you need to turn off necessary settings in environment settings. For example, the animations.
